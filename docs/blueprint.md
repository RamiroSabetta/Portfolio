- Primary color: Dark gray (#333333) to emulate a terminal background.
- Background color: Very dark gray (#1E1E1E) to visually differentiate from the primary color in a subtle manner.
- Accent color: Lime green (#32CD32) for text and prompts to mimic classic terminal aesthetics.
- Body and headline font: 'Source Code Pro', a monospaced font (suitable for computer code), to replicate the appearance of a terminal.
- Use a blinking cursor to indicate user input area.
- Layout should mimic a terminal, with a top section displaying text and a bottom section for user input.
- Subtle animations, like the gradual appearance of text, to simulate the terminal experience.
